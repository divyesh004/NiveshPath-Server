NiveshPath Backend Optimization
Changes Implemented
The following optimizations have been made to enhance the performance and scalability of the NiveshPath backend:

1. Caching Mechanism
A new cache.service.js has been added for in-memory caching.

Two cache instances have been created:

chatbotCache: For chatbot responses (TTL: 30 minutes)

userProfileCache: For user profiles (TTL: 1 hour)

Caching implemented for frequently asked questions.

Conversation context caching enabled.

2. Database Query Optimization
MongoDB connection settings optimized.

Improved query performance using .lean().

Pagination queries have been optimized.

Reduced unnecessary countDocuments calls.

3. Response Compression
Added compression middleware.

Enabled compression for all API responses.

Special compression added for chatbot routes.

4. Performance Monitoring
Added response time tracking middleware.

Logging implemented for slow responses (over 500ms).

X-Response-Time header added to all responses.

5. Security Enhancements
Security headers implemented.

JSON body size limit enforced.

Performance Benefits
Reduced database queries due to caching.

Lower network bandwidth usage via compression.

Better scalability through optimized MongoDB connections.

Instant responses for common queries.

Future Improvements
Implement Redis-based caching (currently commented out).

Further optimization of query indexes.

Add a full performance monitoring system with metrics.

Usage
No additional configuration is needed. Optimizations are automatically applied.
